In this task I have created my own dataset from extracting photos from Google Photos and extracting frames from many of my previous videos. The dataset contains over 44000 images of my own self. Then I trained the discriminator along with fake data to classify between real and fake. Once, the discriminator was trained, I then trained the generator to mimic the real data distribution. Everytime the generator outputted a bad result, the error was backpropagated to the generator. The results are just okay at the most. After about 4000 epochs, I started getting the problem of mode collapse and the results didnt improve much.
